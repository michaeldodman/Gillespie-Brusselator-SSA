# Gillespie-Brusselator-SSA

## Description
An object-oriented MATLAB implementation of the Gillespie [1] and the 'Brusselator' [2] stochastic simulation algorithms.

## Dependencies
This project requires only MATLAB to run the stochastic simulation algorithms, however the Signal Processing Toolbox and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox are used for subsequent analysis of the simulations.

## Usage

Run the ```main.m``` file with the class file ```ChemicalReaction.m``` in the same directory, and the ChemicalReaction objects will be instantiated, calculations will be executed, and results of the simulation and analysis will be displayed.
